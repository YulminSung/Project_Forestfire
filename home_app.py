The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. 
The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. 
You will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson‚Äôs disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.

Your work could help provide important breakthrough information about which molecules change as Parkinson‚Äôs disease progresses.
